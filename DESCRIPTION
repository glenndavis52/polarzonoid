Description: In each odd dimension is a convex body - the polar zonoid - whose generating functions are trigonometric polynomials.  The polar zonoid is a straightforward generalization of the polar zonohedron in dimension 3, as defined by Chilton and Coxeter (1963) <doi:10.2307/2313051>. The package has some applications of the polar zonoid, including the properties of configuration spaces of arcs on the circle and 3x3 rotation matrices.  There is also a root solver for trigonometric polynomials.
